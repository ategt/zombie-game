# Zombie Survival Game

### [Play in Browser](https://ategt.github.io/zombie-game/)

### Background
I did a kata about zombie survival a few weeks ago, and it was okay, but the kata was all math and the zombies were numbers.  This week, I heard a co-worker talking about a tutorial that he did, which involved building mazes with canvas.  I already have a maze building kata, so I decided to make it into a zombie survival game.

### Prerequesites
* Node - v8.7.0
* NPM  - 5.5.1

Or at least those are the versions that I have.

`npm install`

then launch the index.html file.
