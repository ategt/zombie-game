# Zombie Survival Game

## Background
I did a kata about zombie survival a few weeks ago, and it was okay, but the kata was all math and the zombies were numbers.  This week, I heard a co-worker talking about a tutorial that he did, which involved building mazes with canvas.  I already have a maze building kata, so I decided to make it into a zombie survival game.

## Prerequesites
* Node - v8.7.0
* NPM  - 5.5.1

Or atleast those are the versions that I have.

## Quickstart
After cloning the repository to a local directory, run:

`npm install`

then launch the index.html file.

Run `tape zombies.tests.js` or `npm test`
